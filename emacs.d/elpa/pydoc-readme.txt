This module runs pydoc on an argument, inserts the output into a
buffer, and then linkifies and colorizes the buffer. For example,
some things are linked to open the source code, or to run pydoc on
them. Some things are colorized for readability, e.g. environment
variables and strings, function names and arguments.
