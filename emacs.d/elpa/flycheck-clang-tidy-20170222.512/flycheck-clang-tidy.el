;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)

(flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-clang-tidy c/c++-clang-tidy ".clang-tidy"
  :safe #'stringp)

(flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-clang-tidy-build-path "build" c/c++-clang-tidy
  "Build path to read a compile command database.

For example, it can be a CMake build directory in which a file named
compile_commands.json exists (use -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
CMake option to get this output)."
