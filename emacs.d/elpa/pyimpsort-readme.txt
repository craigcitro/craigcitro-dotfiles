[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/emacs-pe/pyimpsort.el.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emacs-pe/pyimpsort.el)

`pyimpsort.el' sort the python imports of a file.
Currently uses [pyimpsort.py](pyimpsort.py) to process the way to sort python
imports.

Setup
Add the following snippet to your `init.el':

    (require 'pyimpsort)
    (eval-after-load 'python
      '(define-key python-mode-map "\C-c\C-u" #'pyimpsort-buffer))

Troubleshooting:
+ **Doesn't sort correcly third party libraries**

  `pyimpsort.el' tries to identify the third party libraries if are installed
  in in the PYTHONPATH, if a package is not installed it is assumed that
  belongs to the application.
  `pyimpsort.el' also tries to identify if a python virtualenv
  is activated.
