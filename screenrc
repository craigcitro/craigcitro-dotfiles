# C-space sets mark. markkeys does it in screen 4.0 and higher, but 3.9x
# needs the bindkey command. (note the ^@ escape sequence for C-space.)
markkeys ' '=^@

# page up and page down
bindkey -m -k kP stuff Y
bindkey -m -k kN stuff V

# failed attempt to make C-space work in i-search too
# bindkey -m ^@ eval "stuff \033" "stuff ^@" 

# special hack for C-e, since it should go *past*
# the last char. -m means this is for copy mode only.
bindkey -m ^e stuff "$^f"

# C-g and other keys just quit copy mode. Esc does nothing.
